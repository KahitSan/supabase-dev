## Benchmarking Tool

We've created a comprehensive benchmarking tool to test all DigitalOcean plans:

```bash
cd docker

# List available plans
./benchmark.sh list

# Start with specific plan limits
./benchmark.sh start 4gb          # 4GB plan
./benchmark.sh start unlimited    # No limits

# Run benchmark on specific plan
./benchmark.sh test 2gb

# Run benchmarks on ALL plans (takes ~30-45 minutes)
./benchmark.sh test-all

# Check current resource usage
./benchmark.sh stats

# Stop services
./benchmark.sh stop
```

---

## Test Methodology

Each benchmark includes:

1. **Startup Test** - Can services start successfully?
2. **Idle Resource Usage** - Memory/CPU at rest
3. **Load Testing:**
   - Database connectivity
   - 1000 row inserts
   - 100 concurrent queries
   - 10 concurrent connections
   - 5000 large row inserts
   - Full table scans
4. **Health Checks** - Are services still healthy?
5. **Resource Limits** - Did any service hit limits?

**Status:** ❌ **NOT VIABLE**

**Specs:**
- 512 MB RAM / 1 CPU
- 10 GB SSD
- 500 GB transfer

**Expected Results:**
- Services will fail to start or crash immediately

## Cost vs Performance Analysis

### Best Value Plans

1. **4GB / 2 CPUs ($24/mo)** - Best all-around choice
   - Comfortable for most production needs
   - Room to grow
   - Stable under load

2. **2GB / 2 CPUs ($18/mo)** - Budget conscious
   - Better than 2GB/1CPU
   - Extra CPU helps performance
   - Limited headroom

3. **8GB / 4 CPUs ($48/mo)** - High traffic
   - When 4GB isn't enough
   - Excellent performance
   - Future-proof

### Plans to Avoid

- **512MB** - Cannot run Supabase
- **1GB** - Fails under production load
- **2GB / 1 CPU** - Only if budget is tight AND traffic is very low

## Comparison with Managed Supabase

| Service | RAM | Cost/mo | Management | Support | Scaling |
|---------|-----|---------|------------|---------|---------|
| **DIY 4GB DO** | 4GB | $24 | Self | None | Manual |
| **Supabase Pro** | Varies | $25 | Managed | Email | Auto |
| **DIY 8GB DO** | 8GB | $48 | Self | None | Manual |
| **Supabase Team** | Varies | $99 | Managed | Priority | Auto |

**Recommendation:** For $24 vs $25/mo, managed Supabase Cloud offers better value unless you specifically need self-hosting.

---

## Resource Allocation Strategy

Our configurations allocate resources as follows:

**Priority Order:**
1. **Database** (~40-50% of RAM) - Most critical
2. **Kong** (~15-20%) - API gateway
3. **Pooler** (~15-20%) - Connection management
4. **Studio** (~10-15%) - Dashboard
5. **Storage** (~8-12%) - File handling
6. **Other Services** (remaining)

**Why Database gets most RAM:**
- Most critical service
- Benefits greatly from memory
- Handles all data operations
- Caching improves performance significantly

## Running Benchmarks

### Test Single Plan

```bash
cd docker
./benchmark.sh test 4gb
```

Output includes:
- Initial resource usage
- Load test results
- Final resource usage
- Service health status
- Results saved to `/tmp/benchmark-4gb.txt`

### Test All Plans

```bash
cd docker
./benchmark.sh test-all
```

- Tests all 7 plans sequentially
- Takes ~30-45 minutes
- Generates summary report
- Results in `/tmp/do-benchmarks-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Start with 4GB limits
cd docker
./benchmark.sh start 4gb

# Check resources
./benchmark.sh stats

# Run load test manually
./load-test.sh

# Stop when done
./benchmark.sh stop
```

### No Limits (Development)

```bash
# Start without resource limits
./benchmark.sh start unlimited

# Your local machine specs apply
./benchmark.sh stats
```

---

## Recommendations Summary

**For Development:**
- Use `unlimited` (no limits)
- Or 1GB if testing deployment

**For Production:**

| Users | Recommended Plan | Cost |
|-------|-----------------|------|
| < 1,000 | 2GB / 1 CPU | $12/mo |
| 1,000 - 5,000 | 4GB / 2 CPUs | $24/mo |
| 5,000 - 20,000 | 8GB / 4 CPUs | $48/mo |
| 20,000+ | 16GB / 8 CPUs or Managed | $96/mo |

**Alternative:** Supabase Cloud at $25/mo (Pro) offers better value than self-hosting for most cases.

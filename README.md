# Supabase Self-Hosted Infrastructure

Optimized Docker Compose setup for self-hosting Supabase with reduced resource usage. Suitable for both production and development environments.

> **Based on**: [supabase/supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase) - The official Supabase repository

---

## What's Different from Official Supabase?

This repository is an **optimized fork** of the official Supabase self-hosting setup with the following customizations:

### 🎯 Key Changes

1. **Resource Optimization** (~1.6 GB vs ~3+ GB)
   - Disabled: Realtime, Analytics, Edge Functions, Vector logging
   - Ideal for development and small-scale deployments
   - See [OPTIMIZATION.md](./OPTIMIZATION.md) for details

2. **Custom PostgreSQL Port** (54322 instead of 5432)
   - Avoids conflicts with existing PostgreSQL installations
   - Internal: 5432, External: 54322

3. **Automated Setup**
   - Single command setup with validation
   - Auto-downloads missing initialization files
   - Configured for immediate use

4. **DigitalOcean Benchmarking**
   - Resource limit testing for different droplet sizes
   - See [DIGITALOCEAN-BENCHMARKS.md](./DIGITALOCEAN-BENCHMARKS.md)

5. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Comprehensive workflows and troubleshooting
   - Claude Code integration guide
   - Development-focused quick reference

**When to use this fork:**
- Production deployments on resource-constrained servers (VPS, small droplets)
- Local development environments
- Self-hosted setups where Realtime/Edge Functions aren't needed
- Learning Supabase internals
- Cost-effective production hosting

**When to use official Supabase:**
- Need Realtime subscriptions or Edge Functions
- Require full feature set including analytics
- Enterprise-scale deployments

## Quick Start

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Access dashboard: **http://localhost:8000**

---

## Common Commands

### Standard Startup (No Limits)

```bash
# Start Supabase without resource limits
./setup.sh

# Reset everything (⚠️ deletes all data)
./setup.sh --reset

# View logs
cd docker && docker compose logs -f

# Stop services
cd docker && docker compose down
```

### Startup with Resource Limits (DigitalOcean Simulation)

```bash
cd docker

# Start with specific DigitalOcean plan limits
./do-limits.sh start 4gb          # 4GB / 2 CPU plan ($24/mo)
./do-limits.sh start 2gb          # 2GB / 1 CPU plan ($12/mo)
./do-limits.sh start unlimited    # No limits (default)

# Check resource usage
./do-limits.sh stats

# Stop services
./do-limits.sh stop
```

See [DIGITALOCEAN-BENCHMARKS.md](./DIGITALOCEAN-BENCHMARKS.md) for all available plans.

## What This Provides

| Service | URL/Port |
|---------|----------|
| Dashboard | http://localhost:8000 |
| API | http://localhost:8000 |
| Database | localhost:54322 |

Credentials are in `docker/.env`

**⚡ Optimized Setup**: By default, realtime, analytics, edge functions, and vector logging are disabled to reduce resource usage (~1.6 GB total). See [OPTIMIZATION.md](./OPTIMIZATION.md) to re-enable these services if needed.

---

## Configuration

**Key Settings:**
- `POSTGRES_PORT=5432` - Internal Docker network port
- `POSTGRES_EXTERNAL_PORT=54322` - Host machine access port

See `docker/.env` for all configuration.
